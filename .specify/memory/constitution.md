# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - Project Constitution

## Project Overview
Create a complete Docusaurus-based educational textbook for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with an integrated RAG chatbot using Qwen LLM, retro-themed UI, and full deployment pipeline using Spec-Kit Plus workflow.

## Core Principles

### 1. Educational Excellence
- All content must be technically accurate and aligned with the source PDF
- Learning outcomes clearly defined for each chapter
- Code examples must be functional and well-explained
- Content should be accessible to advanced CS/Engineering students

### 2. PDF Fidelity
- All content must derive from the source PDF: `Hackathon_I__Physical_AI___Humanoid_Robotics_Textbook.pdf`
- Maintain original course structure (13 weeks, 4 modules)
- Preserve learning objectives and technical depth
- Ensure all hardware requirements and project guidelines are included

### 3. Qwen Integration
- Seamless integration of Qwen LLM for educational assistance
- RAG pipeline must provide accurate, contextual responses
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Citations to specific chapters/sections in responses

### 4. Retro Aesthetics
- Consistent 80s computing theme throughout the UI
- Visual design should enhance, not distract from content
- Terminal-style interfaces for chatbot and navigation
- CRT effects and scanlines should be subtle but present

### 5. AI Integration
- Chatbot provides genuine educational value
- Text selection queries should work seamlessly
- Multi-turn conversations with memory
- Context-aware responses with proper citations

### 6. Code Quality
- Production-ready, well-documented codebase
- Follow best practices for TypeScript, Python, and Docusaurus
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean, maintainable architecture

### 7. Performance
- Fast page load times (<2 seconds)
- Responsive chatbot with <3 second response times
- Optimized vector embeddings and search
- Efficient resource utilization

### 8. Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Adequate color contrast ratios

### 9. Documentation
- Comprehensive setup guides
- API documentation
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution guidelines

## Success Metrics
